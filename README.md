# Data Warehousing Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains the project files for  "Information Systems for Business Intelligence". The project focuses on ETL processes and data visualization related to UK Car Accidents data.

## Tools and Technologies
- **SQL Server**: Used for managing the databases and performing SQL queries.
- **Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)**: Used to create ETL processes that integrate and transform data.
- **Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS)**: Employed for OLAP and data mining capabilities.
- **Power BI**: Utilized for data visualization, allowing the team to create interactive dashboards and reports.
- **Visual Studio**: IDE used for developing SSIS packages and managing database scripts.

## Project Details
The project involves creating ETL processes for data sources including:
- UK Car Accidents
- UK Postcodes
- LSOA Postcode mapping

## Data Visualization
This project also includes data visualizations, providing insights into:
- The frequency and severity of accidents in various locations.
- Data patterns and trends over time.

## Repository Structure
- `ETL Scripts`: Contains all ETL scripts used in the project.
- `Data`: Sample data files used for processing.
- `Docs`: Documentation and the final report.
- `Visualizations`: Visualization scripts and their outputs.

## Acknowledgments
